### 🔬 **My Machine Learning Journey**

I love experimenting with deep learning models to tackle challenging problems, and I've had the opportunity to work on the following projects:

---

### 🛠️ **Projects**

**YOLOv8 Custom Object Detection (Independent Project)**  
*June 2025*  
Tech: Python, YOLOv8, Colab, Drive, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Trained a YOLOv8s model on a custom-labeled dataset using Colab + Drive.  
- Configured 25 epochs, 224x224 image size, and data paths in `data.yaml`.  
- Evaluated the model with plots, confusion matrix, and bounding boxes.  
- Automated the pipeline using the Ultralytics Python library.

**🖼️ Object Detection Web Application**  
*July 2025*  
Tech: Django REST Framework, YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), Computer Vision  
- Designed and implemented a full-stack object detection system with Django for backend APIs and YOLOv8 for real-time image inference.  
- Built a RESTful interface allowing users to upload images, triggering inference and returning annotated results.  
- Processed detection outputs with bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores, rendered visually and as metadata on the frontend.  
- Integrated Django’s media storage for secure handling of user-uploaded files.  
- Optimized inference pipeline by integrating persistent model loading, reducing response time and improving scalability.

**🐱🐶 Image Classifier (CNN)**  
*June 2025*  
Tech: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas  
- Developed a CNN model to classify cat vs dog images with 92% accuracy.  
- Applied data augmentation and preprocessing for performance improvements.  
- Evaluated the model using a confusion matrix, optimizing for higher precision and recall.

### 🎯 **My Goals**

- **🧠 Master Deep Learning:** Constantly experimenting with cutting-edge models like GANs, Transformers, and Reinforcement Learning.  
- **🌍 Contribute to Open Source:** Building libraries and tools that benefit the broader tech community.  
- **🔒 Build Scalable Systems:** Designing scalable, secure systems using best practices.
