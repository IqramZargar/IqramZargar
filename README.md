🧠 My Machine Learning Journey

I love experimenting with deep learning models to tackle challenging problems, and I've had the opportunity to work on the following projects:

🛠️ Projects
YOLOv8 Custom Object Detection (Independent Project)

June 2025
Tech: Python, YOLOv8, Colab, Drive, NumPy, Matplotlib

Trained a YOLOv8s model on a custom-labeled dataset using Colab + Drive.

Configured 25 epochs, 224x224 image size, and data paths in data.yaml.

Evaluated the model with plots, confusion matrix, and bounding boxes.

Automated the pipeline using the Ultralytics Python library.

Object Detection Web Application

July 2025
Tech: Django REST Framework, YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), Computer Vision

Designed and implemented a full-stack object detection system with Django for backend APIs and YOLOv8 for real-time image inference.

Built a RESTful interface allowing users to upload images, triggering inference and returning annotated results.

Processed detection outputs with bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores, rendered visually and as metadata on the frontend.

Integrated Django’s media storage for secure handling of user-uploaded files.

Optimized inference pipeline by integrating persistent model loading, reducing response time and improving scalability.

Image Classifier (CNN)

June 2025
Tech: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas

Developed a CNN model to classify cat vs dog images with 92% accuracy.

Applied data augmentation and preprocessing for performance improvements.

Evaluated the model using a confusion matrix, optimizing for higher precision and recall.

🎯 My Goals

Master Deep Learning: Constantly experimenting with cutting-edge models like GANs, Transformers, and Reinforcement Learning.

Contribute to Open Source: Building libraries and tools that benefit the broader tech community.

Build Scalable Systems: Designing scalable, secure systems using best practices.
